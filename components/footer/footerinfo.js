        Did ever you wonder where people find the best new cryptocurrency
        projects, coins and tokens like Doge and Shiba Inu? They use websites
        like coinsniper.net. Cryptocurrency projects are listed here before
        CoinMarketCap, CoinGecko and major exchanges. Find the best crypto
        moonshots on our website. However: before investing always do your own
        research (DYOR)! Listing on coinsniper.net does NOT mean we endorse the
        project, they could be scams. Be careful with your investments.

        Time" page, but can count every 24 hours on the "Today" page.
